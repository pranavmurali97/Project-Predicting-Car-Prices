# Project-Predicting-Car-Prices
Using Python and Machine Learning concepts, we predict a car's market price using it's attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. We perform data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning and build both univariate and multivariate models.
